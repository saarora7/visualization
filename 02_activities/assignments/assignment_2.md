# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

    Why it’s good :

        Clear Representation: The funnel chart effectively illustrates the stages of a process in a sequential manner, which makes it easy for users to understand the progression from start to finish. Each stage  is clearly differentiated, allowing viewers to quickly identify where drop-offs occur and which stages retain the most users. This is especially important in process-oriented data, as it communicates insights at a glance without overwhelming the viewer.

        Color Coding: The use of distinct and visually appealing colors for each stage enhances readability and ensures that each stage stands out. This aligns with best practices in data visualization, where color should aid comprehension rather than confuse. The consistent use of color for each stage also helps users quickly compare the relative size of each funnel segment, making interpretation intuitive.

        Interactive Elements: The chart incorporates interactivity, allowing users to hover over individual stages to reveal additional data, such as counts or percentages. This feature provides more detailed information on demand, keeping the visualization uncluttered while still allowing deeper exploration. Interactivity is an essential tool for dashboards and online visualizations, as it enables users to engage with the data and focus on areas of interest.

        Suggestions for Improvement:

        Add Data Labels: While the funnel stages are visually distinct, adding numerical values or percentages directly on each segment would allow users to interpret the data more precisely without having to estimate.

        Provide Contextual Information: Including a title or short description that explains the process being depicted would help users who are unfamiliar with the dataset understand the context immediately. This small addition can significantly improve accessibility and comprehension.

        Overall, this funnel chart demonstrates clarity, effective use of color, and interactive engagement, which are all hallmarks of a good visualization according to our class principles.

    Why it’s bad :

        Overcrowded Layout: The dashboard contains too many visual elements, including multiple charts, tables, and indicators, all displayed simultaneously. This makes it challenging for users to focus on the key insights, as their attention is split across too many areas. Cognitive overload occurs when users are forced to process excessive information at once, which reduces comprehension and can lead to misinterpretation of important trends. A cleaner, simplified layout would help direct attention to the most meaningful data.

        Inconsistent Color Usage: Across the dashboard, colors are applied inconsistently, with some charts using bright, contrasting colors while others use muted tones. This inconsistency can confuse users, making it difficult to associate colors with specific categories or trends. Proper use of a consistent color scheme, aligned with semantic meaning (e.g., red for negative, green for positive), improves readability and reduces cognitive strain.

        Lack of Clear Visual Hierarchy: There is no clear visual hierarchy guiding the viewer’s attention from the most important information to less critical details. Without hierarchy, users may struggle to identify the key metrics or understand the relationships between different data points. Charts and tables should be organized in a way that naturally leads the eye, using size, color, or placement to signal importance.

        Suggestions for Improvement:

        Simplify the Layout: Remove or consolidate non-essential elements, focusing only on the charts or metrics that provide the most actionable insights. Using a minimalist approach allows users to absorb information quickly and accurately.

        Standardize Color Scheme: Apply a consistent color palette across all charts to clearly differentiate categories while maintaining visual harmony. Colors should be chosen not just for aesthetics but for functionality, ensuring they convey meaning intuitively.

        Implement Visual Hierarchy: Organize the dashboard by grouping related information and emphasizing key metrics through larger chart sizes, bold headings, or contrasting colors. Arrange elements in order of importance, so that the most critical insights are immediately noticeable.

        Provide Context and Annotations: Adding descriptive titles, labels, and brief notes explaining each chart would help users interpret the data accurately. Users often rely on context to connect numbers to real-world implications.

        Interactive Features: Where possible, include interactivity such as filters, hover details, or drill-down options. These features allow users to explore the data without overwhelming the dashboard with too many static elements.

        By addressing these issues, the dashboard would become significantly more readable, intuitive, and actionable, transforming it from a confusing visualization into an effective communication tool.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
