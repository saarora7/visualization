    "# Visualization 2: Outbreaks by Outbreak Setting – Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "# Link : https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/outbreaks-in-toronto-healthcare-institutions/        \n",
    "ob_report_2025 CSV file in this link is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Software Used\n",
    "The visualization was created using **Microsoft Excel**. Excel was chosen because the dataset is primarily categorical, and a bar chart could be easily generated using a PivotTable and PivotChart. The chart uses a **black background with blue bars** for a visually striking effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Intended Audience\n",
    "- Public health officials and healthcare administrators in Toronto.  \n",
    "- Policy makers and planners interested in outbreak management.  \n",
    "- Researchers studying healthcare outbreaks in Ontario.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Message / Information Conveyed\n",
    "This bar chart shows the **number of outbreaks across different healthcare institution settings** in Toronto. The design highlights which settings, such as **acute care hospitals, chronic care, and long-term care homes**, experience more frequent outbreaks. The chart helps prioritize outbreak monitoring and intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Design Considerations\n",
    "- **Background:** Black, for high contrast with blue bars.  \n",
    "- **Bar Color:** Blue, to stand out clearly against the dark background.  \n",
    "- **Chart Type:** Bar chart, effective for categorical comparison.  \n",
    "- **Axis Labels:** X-axis shows outbreak settings; Y-axis shows number of outbreaks.  \n",
    "- **Title:** Clear and descriptive to communicate the key message.  \n",
    "- **Readability:** Simple layout with clear spacing to enhance visibility.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Reproducibility\n",
    "- Original CSV file is included for replication.  \n",
    "- PivotTable and PivotChart steps in Excel are documented and can be repeated.  \n",
    "- If Excel is unavailable, the dataset allows replication in alternative software like Python, Tableau, or Google Sheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Accessibility\n",
    "- High-contrast color scheme (blue bars on black background).  \n",
    "- Clear and legible axis labels and title.  \n",
    "- Minimal clutter to reduce visual noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Individuals / Communities Impacted\n",
    "- Toronto residents and patients who may be affected by outbreaks.  \n",
    "- Healthcare staff and administrators responsible for outbreak prevention.  \n",
    "- Public health researchers and planners.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Feature Selection\n",
    "- Included: **Outbreak Setting** (categorical) and **_id** (count of outbreaks).  \n",
    "- Excluded: Other details like Causative Agent or exact dates, to maintain a clear focus on the number of outbreaks per setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Underwater Labour\n",
    "- Cleaning and preparing the dataset.  \n",
    "- Creating the PivotTable and PivotChart with correct aggregation.  \n",
    "- Designing the chart with high-contrast colors, readable labels, and a descriptive title.  \n",
    "- Documenting steps to ensure reproducibility and accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**  \n",
    "The visualization provides a visually striking view of outbreak frequency across healthcare settings in Toronto, designed for clarity, accessibility, and immediate comprehension by technical and non-technical audiences alike.\n"
